# nvim

My (neo)vim configuration files.

The `vimscript` branch allows for a more backwards-compatible and simpler version of my neovim configuration. Since I almost entirely use neovim, the intent behind my `vimscript` branch is to have a version that works on the older versions of vim and neovim that my university's lab machines have installed.

## Installation

If using vim, symlink or copy `init.vim` to `~/.vimrc`. Them symlink or copy `config` to `~/.config/vim`.

If using neovim, you can just simlink or copy the entire repository to `~/.config/nvim`.
