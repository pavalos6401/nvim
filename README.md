# nvim

My (neo)vim configuration files.

The `vimscript` branch allows for a more backwards-compatible and simpler
version of my neovim configuration. Since I almost entirely use neovim, the
intent behind my `vimscript` branch is to have a version that works on the
older versions of vim and neovim that my university's lab machines have
installed.

## Installation

If using vim, clone the repository to `~/.vim` and symlink or copy `init.vim`
to `~/.vimrc`

If using neovim, just clone the repository to `~/.config/nvim`.
