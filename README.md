# nvim

My (neo)vim configuration files.

The `vimscript` branch allows for a more backwards-compatible and simpler version of my neovim configuration. Since I almost entirely use neovim, the intent behind my `vimscript` branch is to have a version that works on the older versions of vim and neovim that my university's lab machines have installed.

## Installation

For installation instructions look at the wiki in my [gitlab repo](https://gitlab.com/pavalos6401/nvim).
